# portfolio-bootstrap

A three page site built as a basis for a future personal website and portfolio using bootstrap elements. Currently has navigation between the index, which contains a short bio, the contact page, which has a functionless form, and a portfolio, which has placeholder images that will be replaced with future projects. Also contains a footer, which currently has just my name, but can be updated with a link to a resume, LinkedIn, and/or any other important professional sites or information.
