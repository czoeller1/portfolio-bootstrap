# portfolio-bootstrap

A three page site built as a basis for a future personal website and portfolio using bootstrap elements. Currently has navigation between the index, which contains a short bio, the contact page, which has a functionless form, and a portfolio, which has cards for three functional sites from the bootcamp. Also contains a footer, which currently has my nameand links to my resume, github page, and linkedIn profile.
